*Disclaimer - there are definitely more scientific definitions of many of the items on this list, but technical accuracy doesn't always help us to understand things, does it?.*

The following words crop up again and again in my work, there's a particular bias towards those bandied around in the field of transparency and accountability - because, hey, that's where I work. 


# The A-Z 

* **API** I have yet to find a way to describe this better than [@veltman](https://twitter.com/veltman): "API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. Don’t worry about the AP, just focus on the I. An API is an interface. You use interfaces all the time. A computer operating system is an interface. Buttons in an elevator are an interface. A gas pedal in a car is an interface. An interface sits on top of a complicated system and simplifies certain tasks, a middleman that saves you from needing to know all the details of what’s happening under the hood." *Read his whole fantastic tutorial on the [School of Data blog](http://schoolofdata.org/2013/11/18/web-apis-for-non-programmers/).*
* [Bacon filtering](http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech/2011/0613/How-to-manage-in-box-bacon) - filtering out those annoying but necessary emails that aren't quite personal emails, but aren't quite spam, but things like notifications from your bank, phone-bills etc. 
* [WYSIWYG](http://xkcd.com/1341/) - What you see is what you get. A fancy way of putting text into a computer, so that it looks less like something from the matrix and more like something you would be happy to print.

Jargon busting techniques

I spend quite a bit of my working life training people. Sadly not as much as I used to. 

One thing I learned was that: As a trainer, when experimenting with new material - it's easy to get carried away in the moment. It’s so easy to start talking too techie, not noticing that the learners are totally lost - to ashamed to put up their hands to ask "you keep saying API - what does it mean?". 

Here's my favourite exercises for making sure training sessions stay jargon free and that you bring your audience along with you. 

# Ten hundred words 

*Audience:* For the training of trainers 
*Purpose*: Discourage your trainers from using jargon

The nerds among you will likely be familiar with the ultimate online geek comic [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) - which shines light into some of the geekiest topics on the planet. (Aside: you know you have truly achieved nerd status when you understand all of the jokes there.) Some of you will also be familiar with the "Up-Goer-Five comic" where Randall (the author) labels a rocket, in all of it's complexity, using only the top "ten hundred" aka "one thousand"  (apparently, "thousand" didn't make it into the top 1000 words, but "computer" did!) words. The result is very amusing:

## How it works: 

It can be very funny to try and explain some of the most complex topics in tech using the same method - and you can use the ["up-goer five text editor"](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) to help you. The text editor only allows you to enter words that appear in the top 1000 most popular words.

1. Set your team the challenge to brainstorm a list of the concepts that people find most problematic during training. Need some words to get you started? Try: API, data, XML, pull request, sandbox. 
2. Set another team member the challenge of coming up with the best definition using the text editor. 
3. Revel in the comedy of watching the frustration. 
4.[optional] I first tried this exercise at [Transparency Camp in 2013](http://transparencycamp.org/). Here were our [definitions](http://transparencycamp.org/schedule/2013/translating-tech/). To test our success: we tweeted out our definitions on the conference and #translatetech hashtags to see if people could reverse engineer them and tweet back at us the term we were trying to define... 

Now, obviously, in an actual training session, you might find it more appropriate not to be limited by actually only using the definitions that you come up with as part of this exercise. 

However, experience shows, that if you are trying to convey to your trainers how important it is not to bewilder your trainees with too much jargon - having them go through this before training leaves some marks to help them catch themselves before letting the jargon out of their mouths. 

# Term Hack 

*Audience*: Participants (the whole spectrum - from bashful to overconfident)
*Purpose*:  Encourage participants to surface terms that they are most interested in learning about, to tailor training towards their needs. 

I once heard a story of a government employee, who managed to corner another of his colleagues as he was entering the lift. Secure in the knowledge that he was no longer being overheard, he turned to his colleague and said: "Paul - you have to help me, I keep saying API and that we should have an API, but that's just because everyone else keeps saying it, I actually have no idea what it means."

This is an exercise to create a safe space to allow people to raise concerns such as these, without fear of ridicule - and to finally get the answers to the questions they care about, and hopefully make better decisions as a result  :) 

## How it works: 

The end aim is to have a wall full of posits with terms on - which the learners would like to understand better. 

At the beginning of the training, hand out a block of post it notes and a pen to each participant. Tell them, that any time they hear you say a word which either they don’t understand, or would like you to unpack any further, they should write it on the post-it and stick it up on the wall. If you have a small group or a well laid out room, you might want to encourage people to do this as you talk, so that it encourages others to do the same, and you can pick up if you are using loads of words your learners are not following. 

Towards the end of the session / day, allow your participants to browse the wall of post-its and mark them with a sticky dot if they also do not know what the words mean or are a little unsure how to use it in context. This way, you will get a good feel for the knowledge in the room and the next day - you can unpick the words in more detail in your explanations. 

Once I have got the words, I sometimes like to play a bit more to get people to get more of a feeling for the terms. Two of my favourites for the tech sphere: 

* Arrange the post-its according to their buzz word factor. 
* Cluster by theme 

This works particularly well if you can do this early on in the training, then overnight (or lunchtime if it's a one day thing), collect ideas and streamline your definitions based on the questions the room have raised: it's a lot harder to come up with a coherent definition on the spot and people always think of something you haven't prepared! Depending on the words surfaced - it's usually good to prepare some definitions overnight - perhaps you will have some in-depth activities to help people understand common ones that you can whip out if there is interest. Work on helping people to populate the board with definitions in their own words, sometimes they come up with something far better than you would - don't give them a glossary until right at the end. 

As a final exercise to cement learning : shuffle the post-its - and tell the room to pair them back up again.

# Jargon Goggles

*Audience*: Participants 
*Purpose*: To give your participants a mechanism to indicate that they are not able to follow what you are saying, without breaking the flow of you talking by having to ask a question. 

Your audience will determine how silly you can make the hand gestures, but here are the ones we used at  the [Info Activism Camp](https://camp2013.tacticaltech.org/) (*Credits* <-) from which I stole this:

Tips: Demonstrate these to your room, showing that you have no shame yourself; you'll get even stiff-upper-lipped English people to do them. Refresh them on a regular basis, the beginning of each new day!

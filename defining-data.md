# Defining Data 

## The Activity

At a lot of the events I attend, there is a tendency to talk about data - as if it were a homogenous, unchanging thing rather than reflecting the diversity and scope of different types of data project. 

It's pretty dangerous territory to be in - particularly for the civic tech and open data movements as the wave of paranoia resulting from privacy scares and responsible data narratives start to take over. If these movements are not careful to define the realms in which it is appropriate to open data and where not, a knee-jerk reaction threatens to shut down data release or data collection before we have seen the true potential that it could hold.

As a reaction to this, I had been asked to run the exercise of coming up with a typology of data a couple of times - first at the [Ethics of Data in Civil Society](http://pacscenter.stanford.edu/content/ethics-data-conference) in Stanford, where I got my dress rehearsal, and secondly recently at a kick off event for the Civicus [DataShift](http://civicus.org/thedatashift/). The context was slightly different each time, but I think I have finally found a way to frame the activity such that it makes it accessible to a broad spectrum of people -while still capturing numerous different ways that we could categorise data to build a typology. Ultimately - any dataset will ultimately fit into multiple categories - depending on what you are interested in.

### Required materials 

* Post-it notes (2 colours)
* Sharpies (or other bold pens)

### Step 1: (Brain)Storm

Ask members of your group to write down any adjective which they have heard of as applying to data. That could be any adjective from 'big' to 'messy'. Give them 4-5 minutes to think about it on their own. 

### Step 2: Splat 

Have everyone put their post-it notes on a wall - let people see the range of answers which people have come up with. 

### Step 3: Snake (Or 'cluster' - but that breaks the alliteration)

Have people work out whether there are any patterns or themes, then group the post-its by theme into a 'snake'. Give the snake a 'title' - i.e. what does it represent? 

### Step 4: Step Back

As a group - take a look at the first draft of the typology. What do you observe - is there anything missing? Feel free to respond as appropriate - this may be adding additional post-its or even columns. 


## Where Next? The Data Stork

I recently pitched this exercise as the first step a way of understanding where data comes from an event which was talking a lot about crowdsourcing (I called it "the data stork"). Once we had surfaced the different ways to define data - we were able to then have a meaningful conversation about how different types of them might come from - which led to a more nuanced way of looking at crowdsourcing as a topic. 

One of the participants also suggested we generate a [Family Fortunes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Fortunes), or [Pointless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_(game_show)) game around the adjectives - which I thought was an excellent idea.

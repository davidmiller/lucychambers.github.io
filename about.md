Tech Translation is my hobby, and this is my playground. 


<div class="well">
<p><strong>Tech Translation</strong></p>
<p>/tɛk transˈleɪʃ(ə)n,trɑːns-,-nz-/</p>
<p><em>noun</em></p>
<p>The practice of translating technical topics into a form that can be more easily understood, absorbed or identified with by those who consider themselves 'non-techies'.</p>
</div>


[Musings](http://techtohuman.com/musings/) is a scratchpad: experiments to make sense of technical topics myself and to explain them to other people. 

It includes everything from facilitation techniques to explanations I have found useful myself as a data trainer and as someone who got thrown in the deep end on numerous technical projects early on in my career. 

Explicitly non-perfect: these musings are version-controlled, learning-out-loud pieces which I update as my thinking evolves.

<div class="well">
<p><strong>Tech Translation</strong></p>
<p>/tɛk transˈleɪʃ(ə)n,trɑːns-,-nz-/</p>
<p><em>noun</em></p>
<p>The practice of translating something technical into a form that can be more easily understood, absorbed or identified with by 'non-techies'.</p>
</div>

Tech Translation is my hobby, and this is my playground. 

[Musings](http://techtohuman.com/musings/) is a scratchpad: experiments to make sense of technical topics myself and to explain them to other people. It will includes everything from facilitation techniques to actual explanations I have found useful myself either as a data trainer or as someone making the gradual transition from clueless to clue-ed in about technology. Explicitly non-perfect: these musings are intended less like blog posts and more as version-controlled, learning-out-loud pieces which I update as my thinking changes.

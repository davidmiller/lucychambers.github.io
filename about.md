<div class="well">
<p><strong>Tech Translation</strong></p>
<p>/tɛk transˈleɪʃ(ə)n,trɑːns-,-nz-/</p>
<p><em>noun</em></p>
<p>The practice of translating something technical into a form that can be more easily understood, absorbed or identified with by 'non-techies'.</p>
</div>

Tech Translation is my hobby, and this is my playground. 

[Musings](http://techtohuman.com/musings/) is a scratchpad: Where I can't find examples, I am inclined to make up definitions and explanations myself. There's a lot of blossoming thoughts in there. As you will see from introduction, these are less like blog posts, and more explicitly version-controlled, learning-out-loud pieces: I would never publish anything if I waited for it all to be perfect. 

*And no, the title is not a reference to me thinking "techies" are somehow not human.*

Tech Translation is my hobby, and this is my playground. 


<div class="well">
<p><strong>Tech Translation</strong></p>
<p>/tɛk transˈleɪʃ(ə)n,trɑːns-,-nz-/</p>
<p><em>noun</em></p>
<p>Stripping jargon out of technical topics to make them more accessible.</p>
</div>


[Musings](http://techtohuman.com/musings/) is a scratchpad. Explicitly non-perfect: these posts are version-controlled, learning-out-loud pieces which I update as my thinking evolves. 

## Topics covered here:

* Experiments in teaching data skills - particularly for NGO and journalist audiences. (Jump to: **[Data Posts](http://techtohuman.com/tags.html#Data 101), [Jargon Busting Posts](http://techtohuman.com/tags.html#Jargon)**)
* Facilitation for strategising & planning tech projects - particularly building products that address real user needs. (Jump to: **[Facilitation Posts](http://techtohuman.com/tags.html#Facilitation), [Strategy Posts](http://techtohuman.com/tags.html#Strategy)**)
* Non-profit and for-profit landscapes - what we can learn from how they approach particular scenarios, the evolving landscape of philanthropy and comparisons between open- and closed-source solutions to similar problems. (Posts coming soon)

<h3> About Me </h3> 
<p>
<strong><em>Summary and current status</em>: I started my career in civic technology, open data and tech capacity building at the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> where I worked from 2011-2015. I have recently left to take a break and write about what I have learned in the process. </strong> </p>

<p>
The last four years have been a steep and enjoyable learning curve. I began as a community builder, becoming a researcher then project manager before finally becoming "Knowledge Director", responsible for leading programs to build data skills within NGOs. 
</p>

<h3> Some highlights </h3>

<ul> 
	<li> <strong> Leading <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/">School of Data</a></strong>: pivoting the project from an online platform to a hub of facilitation methodologies and materials supporting a global network of data trainers. <em>For a peek at the journey we went on, see a snapshot of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121001123004/http://schoolofdata.org/">online platform from 2012</a> and the<a href="http://2014.schoolofdata.org/">2014 annual report.</a></em>  </li> 
	<li><strong>  Co-editing the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism Handbook</a></strong> with <a href="http://jonathangray.org/">Jonathan Gray</a> and <a href="http://lilianabounegru.org/">Liliana Bounegru</a>. </li> 
	<li> <strong>Mentoring NGOs on their technology projects</strong> with the <a href="http://tech.transparency-initiative.org/strategy-session/tabridge-open-mentoring/">Transparency and Accountability Initiative</a>. This included everything from helping organisations navigate pre-existing open-source solutions to sharing the basics of user centric design for their projects.</li> 
	<li> <strong> Working on <a href="http://openspending.org/">OpenSpending</a> </strong>, the world's largest open database of public spending. I learned a lot, then co-authored a <a href="http://community.openspending.org/research/gift/">report</a> for the <a href="http://fiscaltransparency.net/">Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency</a> concluding that a lightweight global standard for budget data would vastly improve data usability and make possible a range of technical solutions to routine, mundane and time-consuming tasks currently performed by NGOs trying to analyse the data. This recommendation was picked up, and I was given the opportunity to shepherd the <a href="http://community.openspending.org/2014/07/a-specification-for-budget-data-introducing-the-budget-data-package/">first prototypes of the specification</a> through their paces.</li> 
</ul> 


<h3> Other things you might find interesting </h3> 

<ul> 
	<li> I am currently learning Portuguese (but at a very early stage!). Feel free to talk to me in Russian or German - I could use the practice. I also speak rusty French and Ukrainian. All languages have hint of Russian accent.</li>  
	<li> Spending a lot of time speaking other languages means that creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism">neologisms</a> and funky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque">calques</a> has become a hobby of mine. Some find this endearing, but please shout if it inhibits comprehension.  </li> 
	<li> My hair always does this in photos. If you see one without this distinctive feature, it's probably not me. </li>

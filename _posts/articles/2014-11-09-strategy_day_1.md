This post contains the activities for Day 1 of the strategy retreat. For more information and the links to the activities from other days, please see the [strategy retreat post](http://techtohuman.com/strategy_retreat/). 

## Day 1 

1. [Moshpit! Agenda Hacking](http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Agenda:Hacking) - Courtesy of Aspiration Tech.
2. [Stakeholder Mapping & Power Analysis](https://www.fabriders.net/spectrogram-stakeholder-map/) - Fabriders classic. I went one step further and made the team make scarecrows of key stakeholders for us to interview about how they felt about certain activities to keep them at the forefront of everyone's mind. The scarecrows were a bit intimidating - so think this activity might need a bit more work! (See below)

<ol start="3">
  <li>Temperature check - mini retrospective. Asking people "Looking back over the last year: What were moments that made you proudest / happiest?" - this was a quick go round to warm people into the next session.</li>
  <li><a href="http://techtohuman.com/strategy_scissors/">Strategy and scissors session</a></li>

DELIBERATELY LONG LUNCHBREAK

<ol start="5">

<li>  <a href="http://techtohuman.com/good_strategy/">Strategy user stories</a>  - We were putting a lot of energy into the strategy, so I wanted people to buy into it - and make sure it was a document that suited their needs so that they would use it. This was a quick brainstorm on a list of requirements from the strategy - with our own team as the user base. </li>
</ol>

BREAK

<ol start="6">

<li> Dreaming big. Go round: Finish the sentence "We should..." - aim is to add new ideas into the mix which were not captured in the first iteration of the strategy. </li>
<li> My plan was to do a  <a href="http://diytoolkit.org/tools/swot-analysis-2/">SWOT analysis (Where SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.)</a> - DIY Toolkit: but we were tight on time. Instead, we did half a SWOT. The SO part (Strengths and Opportunities), figuring that the weaknesses we could surface in the retrospectives. </li>

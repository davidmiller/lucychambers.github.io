# My first strategy retreat with School of Data 

I recently got the opportunity to facilitate my first week-long strategy retreat for School of Data. I'm a big fan of getting external facilitators for things like this, but sadly, we didn't quite have the cash so I did it myself, with a bit of help from my good friend and facilitation guru, [Dirk Slater](http://www.fabriders.net/). 

Dirk encouraged me to share the template - as what we ended up with was pretty solid, and some excellent activities.

Tip: Out of season villas make excellent and cost-effective locations for retreats as you can accommodate your staff, cook on-site and hold the workshops in communal areas - while still giving the necessary seclusion required to focus. To boot, even off season, they are probably pretty warm!

# Preparation: Communicate the arc and how everything will fit together and build on each other

Cheers again to Dirk for impressing on me the importance of having a narrative flow. I was particularly cautious to keep the energy high, and it's inevitable that sometimes, when reality checks set in as plans ripen, people can get disheartened. Reality-checks of our plans were going to be a big part of our plan, so I wanted to manage people's expectations for when the speedbumps came. Above is what I came up with and it appeared to work pretty well! 

The basic flow of the days were: 

* *Day 1: Dreaming big & lookback over the past year*
* *Day 2: Goals & resources* - what do we need to acheive what we set out to do? 
* *Day 3: Forward looking* - first planning session 
* *Day 4: Personal development day* - chance for 1:1 chats with line managers and HR team
* *Day 5: Reality and quality check day* - is what we planned realistic?  How do we improve the quality of our plans? 

I will not unpack all of the activities, as some of them will not be useful to anyone else, but below I will link the best of them and list my lessons learned. 

# Activities 

## Day 1 

1. [Moshpit! Agenda Hacking](http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Agenda:Hacking) - Courtesy of Aspiration Tech
2. [Stakeholder Mapping & Power Analysis](http://www.fabriders.net/pyramid1/) - Fabriders classic. I went one step further and made the team make scarecrows of key stakeholders for us to interview about how they felt about certain activities to keep them at the forefront of everyone's mind. The scarecrows were a bit intimidating - so think this activity might need a bit more work! (See below)

3. Temperature check - mini retrospective. Asking people "Looking back over the last year: What were moments that made you proudest / happiest?" - this was a quick go round to warm people into the next session. 
4. Strategy and scissors session [TODO LINK]

DELIBERATELY LONG LUNCHBREAK 

5. Strategy user stories [TODO LINK] - We were putting a lot of energy into the strategy, so I wanted people to buy into it - and make sure it was a document that suited their needs so that they would use it. This was a quick brainstorm on a list of requirements from the strategy - with the team as the user base. 

BREAK 

6. Dreaming big. Go round: Finish the sentence "We should..." - aim is to add new ideas into the mix which were not captured in the first iteration of the strategy. 
7. My plan was to do a [SWOT analysis](http://diytoolkit.org/tools/swot-analysis-2/) - DIY Toolkit: but we were tight on time. Instead, we did half a SWOT. The SO part (Strengths and Opportunities), figuring that the weaknesses, we coudl surface in the retrospectives.

# Lessons learned 

I'd like to share a couple of key takeaways and words of wisdom which I took from Dirk about the role of a facilitator at an event such as these. 

* In response to my concern that running retrospectives would put the team on a downer: *"Don't allow people to dwell in the negative space"* Yes, people may need an opportunity to bitch sometimes to get something off their chest, however, the key if people have a particular problem, is working out "what can I change?" "what can I not change?". Ultimately - you want people not only to highlight the problems, but realise that they can be part of the solution - it makes everyone feel more positive and shares the workload!
* Get people outside of their own space / Have an ego parking lot. Related to the above - people have a tendency to dwell on their particular pet thoughts. It was important to frame everything as: "how will this contribute to making the programme better?". Ultimately everything - from planning down to personal development, is contributing to the aim of making the programme better, and it is useful to keep the front and centre.  
* "At what point in the agenda are you going to talk about users?" - yup, don't forget to build that in... 
* It's a facilitator's job to keep things positive. I initiatially found the questions: "what were the moments in the last year made you proudest?" and "what do you appreciate about being part of this team?" a bit sacrine and (pardon me) American, but it is surprising how well they set the tone for what could be some hard retrospective questions.

## Day 2

![Day 2 Agenda](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/DSCF3705.JPG)

1. Warmup - Farmers' Market - [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org/). The Farmers' Market is a fantastic mechanism of making lists of resources. <em>The mechanism is simple: 1. Put up 'stations' around the room on a particular topic. (A 'station' is simply a big piece of paper with the title of a list of things which you wish to curate. Ask people two questions a) what is the resource and b) why? [should we use it / is it important] 2. Give your participants a time limit, a pack of post-it notes, a sharpie and the instruction to visit all of the stations within the time-limit. Farmers' market works well for two purposes, a) to extract information which is locked in people's heads, particularly of resources that already exist, things that we should build on, rather than replicate. b) to surface wishlists - things that people wished existed. In our case, the lists which we curated were: i) Tools we need to do our work, ii) processes we need to do our work, iii) roles we wish existed in the team, iv) resources built by others which we should be building on. </em>

2. Review of Goals - What we actually did. This was an emergent session, meaning we hadn't planned it from the beginning. It emerged out of the [strategy and scissors session on day 1](http://techtohuman.com/strategy_day_1/). Some members of the team felt that there were some objectives that we had achieved, but not through the methods we initially intended. We had done a lot of things that were not in the original plan as opportunities emerged and we needed to work out which of those had helped us, and which not. We gave people a list of the high-level objectives which we had said we wanted to achieve a year earlier and asked them what they had done to acheive those things. We ended up with a list of methods which were not in the plan, but we could then estimate for time and work out whether we wanted to continue doing.

BREAK

<ol start="3">

<li> "Organisational Retrospective" - devised by Dirk Slater. This was the single session I was most worried about running, but I think one of the most productive sessions of the entire week. The reason I was worried, was that I knew there were many things my team wanted to surface that frustrated them about the way we are currently set up and not all of them were in my power to change; I was worried about this dampening the energy. Dirk however, came up with a brilliant solution to tackle it. </li>

DELIBERATELY LONG LUNCHBREAK

<ol start="4">

<li> Looking forward - Part 1: Partners and collaborators - A dating game. As an early stage project, we did not have a good typology of different types of partners. We had taken them on new partners as and when we felt appropriate, rather than having a particular partner strategy. It was time to sit down and do two things: 1) Do a dating game: Work out which characteristics would make a partnership not work, work out which ones made us like a partnership and which ones made us want to 'commit for life' - or a long time - so that we could carefully pick which ones we should go with in the future. 2) Create a typology of partners - so that we could meaningfully distinguish between partners in the future.   </li>

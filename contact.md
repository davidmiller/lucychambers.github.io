# Work with me

## Sometimes technology is the answer...

I work with organisations who are exploring how technology can help them in their work. 

I help organisations answer two questions: 

<ol>
	<li> <strong> Will a technical solution make our work better? </strong></li>  
</ol>

If yes - read on. If no - [jump to the next section](#no). 

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>What do we do next?</strong> </li> 
</ol>

I offer skills audits, advice on designing and commissioning products as well as a wealth of experience on which existing solutions may meet your requirements, so that you do not have to start from scratch. 

I am also available for research projects. 

**All of this with a jargon free promise.**

## Sometimes it is not...

Sometimes technology will not help. Sometimes the problem is essentially a human one. I will lend you my brain and what I learned about managing and motivating teams (virtual or otherwise) around technology projects. 

### Specialities: 

* Virtual organisations and teams - including best practices for managing workflows and motivating team members
* Non-profits - both traditional grant funded organisations and hybrid commercial entities
* Building teams to tackle problems - how and when to bring in technical staff
* Process design - I believe in engineering processes so that people can do what you as a manager need them to do without context switching and wasting time 
* Workshop facilitation - from developing strategies to breaking stalemates on a particular issue.
